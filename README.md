The Text Characterization Using Speech Recognition project aims to transcribe spoken words into text and analyze the text to extract meaningful characteristics. This involves leveraging speech recognition technologies to convert audio inputs into written form, followed by text analysis techniques to identify various features such as sentiment, keywords, and topics. The project can be applied in various domains such as customer service, content creation, and accessibility.
